We think that feedback shaped our company. We would have probably never decided to found it without an established feedback culture. It plays a huge role in our ways of working and it's quite embedded into everything we do.

Feedback allows learning and sometimes is necessary to make progress. It supports a process of making small steps towards your destination and changing the course frequently. This way you reach your goals faster!

Feedback allowed us to:

- be better at presenting (every time someone is preparing a presentation, there is a group of people willing to listen to it and give feedback),
- be better at programming (every time someone is writing a non-trivial piece of code there is at least one person reviewing the change and giving feedback, in a project it's usually every user story which gets reviewed),
- be better at writing blog posts (every time someone is writing a blog post, there is at least one person reviewing it).

Feedback also plays an important role in taking care of each other. Being nice, appreciating someone's efforts and actually thanking someone is a part of creating a nice atmosphere in the team. The better the atmosphere, the happier and more productive we all are.

How are we facilitating feedback at Happy Team:

- #feedback channel on Slack, this is meant for continuous feedback in an open and friendly space,
- direct feedback after the talk, this helps us boost our presentation skills and improve the contents of this particular talk,
- code reviews (github + slack), we learned quite a lot from each other during those,
- [karma plugin to Slack](https://github.com/happyteamio/elkarmo), allows us to give +1 to anyone for a specific thing and @karma takes care of leaderboard.

Be creative about when to ask for or give feedback. It's probably better to have it a bit more often. Unexpected forms of giving feedback are also fun! They can work miracles!

People can be afraid of feedback, of criticism and unfair comments. On the other hand people don't always want to give an honest opinion fearing they might offend someone. This can create sort of politeness-deadlock. I got this simple trick from [Rob Conery](https://twitter.com/robconery). Just tell the other person that you really want to improve and you won't be offended (just make sure to keep that promise after hearing honest feedback!). It's kind of obvious but it worked for me a couple of times already. Thanks Rob!

There's a whole lot of knowledge on how to structure feedback so it's the most effective. I could go on and on about that but here's a short and nice summary:

We couldn't be living without feedback, we couldn't be learning and improving. Part of caring about each other is giving honest feedback. Do your friends and coworkers a favour and introduce feedback culture at your workplace. I promise it'll make all of you better and happier!
