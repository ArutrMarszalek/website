We think that feedback shaped our company. We would have probably never decided to found it without an established feedback culture. It plays a huge role in our ways of working and it's quite embedded into everything we do.

Feedback allows learning and sometimes is necessary to make **any** progress. It supports process of making small steps towards your destination and changing the course frequently. This way you reach your goals faster!.

Feedback allowed us:

- be better at presenting (every time someone is preparing a presentation, there is a group of people willing to listen to it and share feedback),
- be better at programming (every time someone is writing a non-trivial piece of code there is at least one person reviewing the change and giving feedback, in a project it's usually every user story which gets reviewed),
- be better at writing blog posts (every time someone is writing a blog post, there is at least one person reviewing it).

Feedback also played an important role of taking care of each other. Being nice, appreciating someone's efforts and actually thanking someone is a part of creating a nice atmosphere in the team. The better the atmosphere, the more happy and productive we all are.

How are we facilitating feedback at Happy Team:

- #feedback channel on Slack, this is meant for a continuous feedback in an open and friendly space,
- direct feedback after the talk, this helps us in improving our presentation skills and a particular talk,
- code reviews (github + slack), we learned quite a lot from each other during those,
- karma plugin to Slack, allows us to give +1 to anyone for a specific thing and @karma takes care of leaderboard.

Be creative about when to ask for or give feedback. It's probably better to have it a bit more often. Unexpected forms of giving feedback are also fun! They can work miracles!

People can be afraid of feedback, of criticism and unfair comments. On the other hand people don't always want to give an honest opinion to not to offend anyone. This can create sort of politeness-deadlock. I got this simple trick from [Rob Conery](https://twitter.com/robconery). Just tell the other person that you really want to improve and you won't be offended (be sure not to be after hearing an honest feedback!). It's kind of obvious but it worked for me a couple of times already. Thanks Rob!

There's a whole lot of knowledge how to structure feedback so it's the most effective. I could go on and on about that but here's a short and nice summary:

We couldn't be living without feedback, we couldn't be learning and improving. Part of caring about each other is giving an honest feedback. Do your friends and coworkers a favour and introduce feedback culture among you. Promise it'll make all of you better and happier!
