title: how remote team can help your business
type: post
---

We are 100% remote in HappyTeam from day one. That was one of the first things we've all agreed to. And we're more than happy to see this approach spreading all over the world with more and more companies that are going remote or remote friendly at least.
 
You can find many articles over the web that will tell you how much better life of a remote developer is, but have you ever considered how being remote or working with remote team could help your business ?
Let's look at this problem from few angles.
 
## Broader talent pool
Right now we have people working from 4 different cities already. By being remote we're not limited to searching people only in one city or area. We can find great people all over the world, ones that share our values, present great expertise and are as passionate about helping our clients as we are!
And that highly skilled and motivated people can work with you on your product!
 
## Remote workers are happier
TINYpulse - company specializing in improving other companies culture and employees engagement - prepared survey ["What leaders need to know about remote workers"](https://cdn2.hubspot.net/hubfs/443262/TINYpulse_What_Leaders_Need_to_Know_About_Remote_Workers.pdf)
They have collected answers from over 500 remote employees and compared their responses with benchmarks calculated from “over 200,000 employees across all work arrangements.”
We can read, that remote workers are happier (based on answer to the question “How happy are you at work?”) and feel more valued (based on answer to questions “How valued do you feel at work?”).
What does it mean for you? I hope you are at least aware of many publications about how general happiness influence employee performance. Happy employee is more engaged with your product, it's more likely he will share his ideas and go that extra mile if needed.
 
## Work-life balance
Being remote also helps keeping healthy work-life balance. Removing daily commute from schedule (and traffic jam can spoil the mood for rest of the day!) let's us spend more time with our families or on hobbies. There is nothing more refreshing than going out of room where I work and play a bit with my little daughter. Even 10 minutes makes me smile, not mentioning it's a good exercise too! And I feel that I'm there when she is rising, not in an office, seeing her just for a moment before sleep.
  
## You often get more organized engineers
That's not an obvious one. Not every great engineer is great remote worker. Being successful remote needs a bit more focus, self organization and motivation. That results in people that feels more self-reliant, ask questions, act by themselves instead of just react to your actions. I'm not saying people in the office can't be similar, they just don't need to.
 
## We've got you covered
Right now all HappyTeam works in one timezone, but even now, with flexible hours we have someone working almost 24/7. People can organize their work to suit their best, no matter is it because someone feels more focused in the early morning or is a night person. That means that even if something bad happens, there is great possibility that someone will be around to help, and with remote work organization you don't need to wait while someone comes to the office.
 
 
## Better communication
There is one rule, that's very important while working with remote people — even if only one employee is remote, whole communication in the organization needs to suit working remote. That's a game changer. As communication cannot be done in person, remote teams put special attention to communicate more deliberately, with more clarity. You can't just talk to someone in the kitchen or tap colleague in the next cubicle. In the effect remote teams makes extensive use of tools. Less decisions are made over the coffee, more are leaving track in documentation. It's easier to share knowledge, as more things are written down, easier to follow decisions
 
## Longer 'zone'
You've probably already heard about 'the zone', state in which developer is completely focused on given task, understands the context and all implications of what's he doing. [This](http://cpuboss.com/blog/dont-interrupt-programmer/) is humorous way to show how 'getting in the zone' works in the office :)
And it's not a myth. Todays applications are big and complicated products with thousands lines of code, often scattered across many interoperating services. It takes an effort to build map of what's going on in a head of developer, so he is able to follow data flows and understand how his code impacts rest of application and what side effect could it cause. In an office it's not an easy task. We're usually sitting in a big open space (although there are number of publications stating it's working against productivity), surrounded by various distractions like group of guys talking about yesterday football game, other team heaving a standup meeting few steps away or  someone talking over the phone next to you. It's not helping keeping you focused. And how it ends? You rent this nice and cosy office in a city centre, as you heard that open space can help collaboration, you hire your developers, enter the room and all you could see is headphones :)
Working remotely helps you manage those interruptions. You can choose where you work and when you work, limiting all the interruptions that could happen and choose what's best for the moment.

 
As you can see, hiring remote teams have way more advantages than reducing costs. It's not a new passing trend, but rather continuous industry effort to increase productivity and quality in IT and in our lives.
